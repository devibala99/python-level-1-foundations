# 🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors Game (CLI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **command-line based Rock–Paper–Scissors game** built using Python.

The game allows a **player to compete against the computer** using classic Rock–Paper–Scissors rules.  
It includes **score tracking, best-of-5 gameplay, and clean exit handling**, simulating a real interactive CLI game.

This project focuses on **game logic, randomness, input validation, and state management**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement player vs computer game logic
- Use randomness to simulate computer behavior
- Track scores across multiple rounds
- Build a menu-driven CLI game
- Handle invalid inputs safely

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Functions
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements
- Random number generation (`random.choice`)
- Lists
- Input validation
- Program entry point (`if __name__ == "__main__"`)
