# 🔢 Prime Number Checker (CLI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a command-line based **Prime Number Checker** built using Python.

The application checks whether a given number is **prime or not** using an **optimized square root (√n) approach**, ensuring better performance compared to brute-force methods.

This project focuses on **mathematical logic, loop optimization, guard clauses, and clean CLI flow**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand prime number fundamentals
- Apply optimized √n logic
- Handle invalid user inputs safely
- Build a menu-driven CLI program
- Use clean, Pythonic guard clauses

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Mathematical logic
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Square root optimization
- Input validation
- Exception handling (`try / except`)
- Menu-driven programs

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Menu-driven CLI interface
- Optimized prime check using √n
- Skips even numbers for efficiency
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Clean exit option
- Pythonic early return logic

---

## 📋 Menu Options

1. Check Prime Number
2. Exit

---

## 🧪 Prime Number Rules Applied

- A prime number must be greater than 1
- 2 is the only even prime number
- Prime numbers have exactly two factors: 1 and itself
- Checking divisibility only up to √n is sufficient
