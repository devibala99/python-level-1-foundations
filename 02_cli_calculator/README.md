# 🧮 CLI Calculator (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) Calculator** built using Python.  
The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through a menu-driven interface.

This project focuses on improving **function usage, control flow, input validation, and error handling**.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Functions
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Exception handling (`try / except`)
- User input handling
- Basic arithmetic operations

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Menu-driven calculator
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Input validation for numeric values
- Division-by-zero handling
- Continuous operation until user exits
- Clear user feedback with emojis

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The program displays a menu of operations
2. The user selects an operation (1–5)
3. The user enters two numbers
4. The selected calculation is performed
5. The result is displayed
6. The program repeats until the user chooses **Exit**

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

```bash
python main.py

## 🖥 Sample Output

Welcome to the calculator application 😎
1. Addition ➕
2. Subtraction ➖
3. Multiplication ✖️
4. Division ➗
5. Exit ❌

Enter the number between 1 - 5 to choose type of calculation: 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Sum of two numbers is 15

## 🔮 Future Improvements

💡 Support for floating-point calculations

💡 Advanced operations (power, modulus)

💡 History of calculations

💡 Improved menu validation

💡 Unit testing
